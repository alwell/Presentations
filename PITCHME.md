- What are the differences between qualitative and quantitative data? 

- Which data collection methods will you be using? Why? 

- What literature have you found to support your choice of data collection methods?  

- What other data collection methods can you use? Why are they important / relevant? (Class / school / local data)

- What are qualitative and quantitative data? 
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of both?

---
- **Qualitative data:** Data that approximates or characterizes but does not measure the attributes, characteristics, properties, etc., of a thing or phenomenon. Qualitative data describes whereas quantitative data defines.

- **Quantitative data:** Information about quantities; that is, information that can be measured and written down with numbers. Some examples of quantitative data are your height, your shoe size, and the length of your fingernails.

---

**Advantages of qualitative data analysis:**

- **Provides depth and detail:** looks deeper than analysing ranks and counts by recording attitudes, feelings and behaviours
- **Creates openness:** encouraging people to expand on their responses can open up new topic areas not initially considered

+++

- **Simulates people's individual experiences:** a detailed picture can be built up about why people act in certain ways and their feelings about these actions.
- **Attempts to avoid pre-judgements:** if used alongside quantitative data collection, it can explain why a particular response was given

---

**Disadvantages of qualitative data analysis:**

- **Usually fewer people studied:** collection of qualitative data is generally more time consuming that quantitative data collection and therefore unless time, staff and budget allows it is generally necessary to include a smaller sample size.
- **Less easy to generalise:** because fewer people are generally studied it is not possible to generalise results to that of the population. Usually exact numbers are reported rather than percentages.

+++

- **Difficult to make systematic comparisons:** for example, if people give widely differing responses that are highly subjective.
- **Dependent on skills of the researcher:** particularly in the case of conducting interviews, focus groups and observation.

- Design draft survey / questionnaire / interview questions and collect feedback from the group. Do your questions need refining? Will the responses giving you the information that you are trying to collect?

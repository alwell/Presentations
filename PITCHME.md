## Numeracy

“Mathematical literacy is an individual’s capacity to identify and understand the role that mathematics plays in the world, to make well-founded judgements and to use and engage with mathematics in ways that meet the needs of that individual’s life as a constructive, concerned and reflective citizen”. (PISA)

## Some examples of what we mean by numeracy:

- being able to critically assess statistics used by advertisers or politicians
- being able to manage family budgets – credit cards, offers at supermarkets and so on
- being able to estimate – in all kinds of situations, e.g. journey speed, time and distance, roughly how much a bill will be or - your expected bank balance at the end of the month...

**Why is it important?**
- employment: people with poor numeracy skills are more than twice as likely to be unemployed as those competent in numeracy.
- social, emotional and behavioural difficulties: Children with these problems are more likely than other children to struggle with numeracy, even taking into account factors such as home background and general ability.
+++
- school exclusions: pupils beginning secondary school with very low numeracy skills but good literacy skills have an exclusion rate twice that of pupils starting secondary school with good numeracy skills.
- truancy: 14-year-olds who had poor mathematics skills at 11 are more than twice as likely to play truant as those achieving the expected skills at 11.
- crime: A quarter of young people in custody have a numeracy level below that expected of a seven-year-old, and 65% of adult prisoners have numeracy skills at or below the level expected of an 11-year-old (read more about levels).
